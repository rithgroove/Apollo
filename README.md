# Welcome to Project Apollo

This game is tactics game concept that I've been developing since I was just an undergrads. The game evolves from XNA game studio, moved to Unity3d, and now, we hopefully we move to Godot (or pygame). The thing is I do hope we could create a basic prototype using python that can be used for reinforcement learning environment.

# Goal

The main goal is to create a small tactical turn based game environment for reinforcement learning. Based on this, we define several quantifiable goals such as:

- Having resource system (Orbs)
- Having points system like most of miniature wargames
- The main feature is to enable researcher to design their own player agents.
- (tentative)Having customizable creatures
